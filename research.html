        <p class="meta">Things I’ve gone through carefully</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <strong>Convex Optimization — Stephen Boyd &amp; Lieven Vandenberghe</strong><br />
            Feels like a modern handbook for optimization. It explains why a problem is convex,
            what that means geometrically, and how we actually design algorithms for it.
            For me it’s the bridge between math and the kind of optimization used in ML,
            control, and signal processing.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra — Boyd &amp; Vandenberghe</strong><br />
            Very clean “engineering” view of vectors, matrices, and least squares. It’s both
            theoretical and very code-friendly, so it’s perfect as a student who wants to really
            understand linear algebra and also implement things.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms — Schulman et al., 2017</strong><br />
            The classic PPO paper. It keeps policy gradients from becoming too crazy by using
            a simple clipping idea to stabilize updates. Roll out, collect data, run a few
            clipped epochs, and you usually get something that actually works — a very practical
            recipe for RL.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Domain Randomization for Transferring Deep Neural Networks from Simulation
              to the Real World — Tobin et al., 2017</strong><br />
            Instead of making the simulator perfectly realistic, you purposely randomize it so
            the network becomes robust. I really like this engineering mindset for closing
            the sim-to-real gap, especially for perception in robotics.

        <p class="meta">Going through slowly, with notes</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            <strong>Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction — Richard S. Sutton &amp; Andrew G. Barto</strong><br />
            I’m working through this one at a slower pace. It builds up returns, value functions,
            TD learning, and control in a very step-by-step way. I’m treating it as my “core
            intuition” book before going deeper into modern deep RL.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Modern Approaches</strong><br />
            I’m reading this in pieces. It extends the single-agent RL story to multi-agent
            settings: cooperation, competition, game-theoretic ideas, and how they connect to
            modern deep RL. I haven’t finished it yet, but it already feels very relevant for
            multi-robot and multi-agent control.
